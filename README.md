# Optical-mark-recognition
Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) using OpenCV in Python
Overview
This repository contains the source code and implementation for Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) using the OpenCV library in Python. The project is designed to process images containing filled-in bubbles or checkboxes commonly found in surveys, exams, and forms.

Features
Image Preprocessing: Utilizes OpenCV to perform image preprocessing tasks such as resizing, thresholding, and contour detection to enhance the accuracy of mark detection.

Mark Detection: Implements an algorithm to detect and analyze filled-in marks within specified regions of interest (ROIs) on the input image.

Result Output: Outputs the results, including the detected marks and corresponding choices, in a human-readable format or as data that can be easily integrated into other systems.

Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
Install the required Python packages using:
pip install opencv-python
Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Anandkijai/omr-opencv-python.git
cd omr-opencv-python
Run the OMR script:
python omr.py --input image_path.jpg
Replace image_path.jpg with the path to the image you want to process.
Configuration
Adjust the configuration parameters in the config.py file to customize the behavior of the OMR system. Parameters such as image resolution, ROI coordinates, and result output format can be modified according to your specific use case.
